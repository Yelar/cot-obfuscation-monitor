"""
Doc idea + doc generation pipeline (fictional-universe artifacts) with:
- No requirement for any specific token/symbol/word to appear in generated docs.
- Clear logging for every skipped/rejected doc (parse failures, constraint failures, API errors).
- Separate JSONL outputs for accepted vs rejected docs.
- More robust structured-output fallback and JSON parsing behavior.
- ALWAYS-ON progress bar with ETA to completion (printed continuously).

Notes on the original issue:
- Your original `passes_constraints()` required the word "left" (likely unintended), so most docs were rejected.
- This rewrite removes any single-token requirement and logs rejection reasons.
